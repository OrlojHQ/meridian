Meridian uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- Command palette. ⌘K on macOS and Ctrl+K elsewhere (never taken from a focused
  terminal, where Ctrl+K is kill-line) opens a searchable list of Capsules,
  sessions, "New Capsule in" each Project, New project, Activity, Threads, and
  Harness settings, plus the current Capsule's full diff, lineage, and Pause or
  Resume, each gated on provider capabilities. Seal and Delete open the
  Capsule's existing confirmation instead of running. Matching is fuzzy, recent
  items come first and stay in page memory, and items show their shortcuts.
  `?` lists every keyboard shortcut. The palette uses only the working set and
  fetches nothing per Capsule.
- Diff review comments. In the Changes tool, including beside the full review
  page, a reviewer can comment on a diff line or a range of lines, then edit or
  remove each comment inline or in a review summary. "Send to agent" composes
  one message that quotes each commented excerpt with its file and line, shows
  it for review, and sends it to a chosen structured Thread (by default the
  Capsule's default session) through the existing Thread message API, then
  opens that session. Terminal-only Capsules get "Copy as prompt" instead;
  Meridian never types into a native PTY. Pending comments stay in browser
  memory for each Capsule and are discarded on reload.
- Change counts. The Changes tab label and the Changes pane header show how
  many files changed and how many lines were added and removed. They come from
  the diff the Changes tool already loaded and add no Git requests.

### Changed

- The Files tool is a collapsible tree. A directory is listed only when it is
  expanded, listings refresh only on request rather than on window focus, and
  arrow keys, Home, End, and Enter move through the tree and open files.
- Activity, Threads, and Harness settings moved from the sidebar footer to the
  top of the sidebar, and Harness settings has an icon.
- Harness settings is organized into Your setups, Import from this computer, and
  Provider connections, with shorter copy and no nested disclosures.
- New project preselects the harness chosen for the last Project created in
  this browser, when the installation still offers it, and otherwise the first
  pack in installation order other than `mock`.
- The standalone Thread page names the agent and links to its Capsule by name
  instead of showing internal identifiers in its heading.
- The New Capsule dialog starts with an agent picker. A Project with no agents
  lists the installed harness packs and adds one in place instead of sending
  the operator to the CLI. Choosing between a terminal and a written task is a
  secondary option under the picker.
- Capsules, sessions, and the agent picker identify each harness by its logo:
  Claude Code, OpenCode, and Pi from simple-icons, and OpenAI's Blossom for
  Codex exactly as OpenAI publishes it. Other harnesses show a monogram.
- Activity sidebar rows show the Capsule's harness, and the selected Capsule
  lists its sessions (native terminal and structured Threads) with their state.
  Idle and paused status dots are hollow; attention pulses.
- The Capsule workspace has a one-line header with the harness, state, Project,
  and an actions menu that holds Pause, Resume, Seal, and Delete. Sessions open
  as tabs in the primary surface, and a Capsule without sessions opens on the
  new-session form. Moments moved to the Activity tool.
- The Capsule tools toggle no longer overlaps the header's state badge.
- The Activity view is an inbox. Capsules that need attention or are ready for
  review come first with direct actions: open the waiting session, see a
  failure and open the Capsule, or open the diff when Git review is supported.
  Working Capsules collapse into a compact list and Idle, Paused, and Sealed
  into one summary. An "All caught up" state still offers to start work.
- A status bar along the bottom of the shell shows browser and daemon
  connectivity, the provider version, and attention, working, and review
  counts. With the fake provider it warns that Capsules are simulated and no
  agents run. It replaces the sidebar's connection indicator.

### Fixed

- "Give it a task" is offered only for a harness pack that can run a
  structured session. No official pack can: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and
  Pi install only native terminal profiles, and the New Capsule dialog now
  shows just the terminal launcher for them. Before, a task for one of these
  packs provisioned a full Capsule whose session failed at once with "Capsule
  runtime rejected structured session start". The daemon now refuses such a
  request with `422 unsupported` before provisioning anything. The
  capabilities `harnessImages` catalog carries a read-only `interactionModes`
  list for packs whose profiles the installation knows. `mock` and custom
  images declare none and are unchanged, because their profiles come from the
  repository.
- The Capsule workspace offers a new structured session only when the
  Capsule's own harness profiles include one. Capsules whose pack installs only
  native terminal profiles, which includes every official pack, no longer show
  a new-session tab that cannot start.
- `meridiand` no longer exits at startup when a Capsule recorded as Ready lost
  its container outside Meridian (for example after a Docker restart). Startup
  recovery fails that Capsule's Run, as ADR 0007 requires, instead of aborting.
- The Seal and Delete confirmation in the Capsule workspace is no longer
  clipped by the Capsule header. It receives focus on "Keep Capsule" and closes
  with Escape.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- `meridiand` defaults to `--provider=docker` and exits at startup with a clear
  error when it cannot reach Docker. `--provider=fake` simulates Capsules for
  tests and UI development only, must be requested explicitly, and logs a
  warning. The `meridiand` image's default command uses the Docker provider.
- The installation harness catalog lists the official agents first and `mock`
  last, so the browser and terminal dashboard preselect a real agent. The
  browser labels `mock` as a test harness with no agent.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- Activity sidebar rows show what each Capsule is doing and for how long, and
  the Activity view groups Capsules into Needs attention, Working, Ready for
  review, Idle, Paused, and Sealed instead of listing internal resource fields.
- Threads report a content-free `awaiting` flag (`permission` or `input`) while
  an active structured session is blocked on the operator. It is derived in
  memory and never persisted in plaintext (ADR 0025).
- `meridiand --runtime-refresh-interval` (default 5s) refreshes live Run state
  and ingests structured Thread output while no client is watching.
- Browser application shell with Project-grouped Capsule activity, unified
  native and structured launch, primary Thread or PTY workspaces, and
  capability-gated Changes, Preview, Files, Terminal, and Activity tools.
- Tag-only releases publish and Cosign-sign official harness pack images
  (`ghcr.io/orlojhq/meridian-capsule-{opencode,pi,claude,codex}`) from the
  thin Capsule image. The installation catalog keeps the Capsule registry and
  tag, or `--official-pack-tag` when the Capsule image is digest-only.
  Released `meridiand` binaries default to those GHCR tags and Docker pulls a
  missing registry image on first Capsule create. Local `:dev` names are never
  fetched from Docker Hub. `deploy/docker/compose.release.yaml` runs a
  published `meridiand` image on the host Docker engine.
- Self-hosted control plane, scriptable CLI, terminal dashboard, and browser
  review interface for coding workspaces.
- Trusted-local Docker and Kubernetes Agent Sandbox providers with owned
  lifecycle resources, restart recovery, pause/resume, and private `capsuled`
  supervision.
- Generic harness execution with Run events, reconnectable PTYs, Git status and
  diffs, local authenticated previews, and deterministic test harnesses.
- Encrypted structured agent Threads with multi-turn messages, tool summaries,
  permission requests, reconnection, and generic, OpenCode, and Pi adapters.
- Immutable filesystem Moments, Timeline lineage, Shards, non-destructive
  Rewind, Seal, and a verified content-addressed artifact store.
- OpenAPI-generated Go and TypeScript clients, SQLite WAL persistence,
  idempotent mutations, optimistic concurrency, and ordered event streams.
- AES-256-GCM encrypted named secrets with purpose binding, Project
  authorization, private HTTPS clone grants, and native/structured harness
  environment references across Docker and Agent Sandbox.
- Thread-first Project sessions with durable encrypted provisioning intents,
  fresh Capsule and Timeline allocation, Ready-state promotion, restart
  recovery, and CLI, TUI, and browser entry points.
- Authenticated bounded workspace browsing and binary-safe review rendering
  through Docker and Agent Sandbox private supervisor clients.
- Safe local worktree sync with matching-origin verification, staged archive
  validation, protected Git metadata, conflict refusal, and explicit force
  mirroring.
- Durable explicitly approved Delivery resources for exact-ref HTTPS pushes and
  host-side idempotent GitHub pull requests, with CLI and browser Ship flows.
- Offline backup, restore, artifact verification and retention, transcript-key
  rotation, Prometheus metrics, optional OpenTelemetry tracing, and hardened
  release automation.
- Helm deployment, provider contract tests, deterministic Docker and Kind
  integration suites, SBOM/checksum/signing policy, and operational
  documentation.

### Fixed

- The Activity view reported each Capsule's oldest Run as its latest.
- Adapter heartbeats no longer count as Capsule activity for idle pausing.

### Security

- Capsules run non-root with bounded resources and never receive the host
  Docker socket, provider credentials, or control-plane state.
- Attach and preview access use short-lived scoped credentials; Capsule
  supervisor, transcript, and credential keys are kept outside SQLite.
- Structured transcripts are encrypted with per-Thread data keys and
  authenticated metadata. Ordinary Run prompts, PTY bytes, diffs, and secret
  values remain excluded from durable events and observability.
- Workspace archives reject traversal, link escapes, special files, expansion
  abuse, corruption, and unsafe replacement; restore and backup publication are
  atomic.
- Local sync never writes or deletes `.git` or `.meridian-prepared`; Delivery
  binds approval to exact reviewed Git objects and supplies purpose-scoped
  credentials only to one narrow operation.
- Telemetry is content-free and bounded. The unauthenticated API and Docker
  previews default to loopback.
- Docker and Agent Sandbox are not claimed as hostile multi-tenant isolation
  boundaries; hardened runtime deployment and external review remain required.
