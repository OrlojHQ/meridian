# Changelog

All notable changes to Meridian will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Meridian will use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) when published
releases begin.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Self-hosted control plane, scriptable CLI, terminal dashboard, and browser
  review interface for coding workspaces.
- Trusted-local Docker and Kubernetes Agent Sandbox providers with owned
  lifecycle resources, restart recovery, pause/resume, and private `capsuled`
  supervision.
- Generic harness execution with Run events, reconnectable PTYs, Git status and
  diffs, local authenticated previews, and deterministic test harnesses.
- Encrypted structured agent Threads with multi-turn messages, tool summaries,
  permission requests, reconnection, and generic, OpenCode, and Pi adapters.
- Immutable filesystem Moments, Timeline lineage, Shards, non-destructive
  Rewind, Seal, and a verified content-addressed artifact store.
- OpenAPI-generated Go and TypeScript clients, SQLite WAL persistence,
  idempotent mutations, optimistic concurrency, and ordered event streams.
- Offline backup, restore, artifact verification and retention, transcript-key
  rotation, Prometheus metrics, optional OpenTelemetry tracing, and hardened
  release automation.
- Helm deployment, provider contract tests, deterministic Docker and Kind
  integration suites, SBOM/checksum/signing policy, and operational
  documentation.

### Security

- Capsules run non-root with bounded resources and never receive the host
  Docker socket, provider credentials, or control-plane state.
- Attach and preview access use short-lived scoped credentials; Capsule
  supervisor and transcript keys are kept outside SQLite.
- Structured transcripts are encrypted with per-Thread data keys and
  authenticated metadata. Ordinary Run prompts, PTY bytes, diffs, and secret
  values remain excluded from durable events and observability.
- Workspace archives reject traversal, link escapes, special files, expansion
  abuse, corruption, and unsafe replacement; restore and backup publication are
  atomic.
- Telemetry is content-free and bounded. The unauthenticated API and Docker
  previews default to loopback.
- Docker and Agent Sandbox are not claimed as hostile multi-tenant isolation
  boundaries; hardened runtime deployment and external review remain required.
